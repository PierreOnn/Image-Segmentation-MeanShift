<h3>Mean Shift Algorithm</h3>

This project entailed the development of an image segmentation application based on the mean shift algorithm.<br/>

Therefore, algorithm.py in the code directory contains the different approaches described by the assignment. In addition, segmentation.py describes the segmentation in regard to the actual images while also referring to functions listed in algorithm.py.  

The use and underhand reasoning behind the functions could be derived from the documented python code.  

In order to execute this code, different tasks are described in main.py to obtain a three-dimensional plot or segmented image dependent on the described parameters.  

The conducted segmentation illustrations are filed under the experiments directory.
